## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Python

You will need Python 3 to use this module

```bash
# vermin output
Minimum required versions: 3.8
Incompatible versions:     2
```

First and foremost you need to download a copy of this repository.

To do so, use git :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Animenosekai/akari.git
```

Or download the zip.

## Installing

Then, you need to install the dependencies.

Use pip to install them :

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run `akari`, you need to launch `run.py` :

```bash
python run.py
```

You would then need to head to your Wii U, open the internet browser, and go to the following page [http://\<your-computer-ip\>:4800](http://<your-computer-ip>:4800)

> ***Note***  
> You need to replace `<your-computer-ip>` with your computer IP address

Once you see `Connected` at the bottom of the webpage, you can head to your favorite DSU client (i.e. Cemu, Ryujinx, etc.) with the port `26760` (the default port for Cemuhook servers according to the [protocol](https://github.com/v1993/cemuhook-protocol)).
